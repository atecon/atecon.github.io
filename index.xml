      <title>Recommended packages for the Sublime editor</title>

      <description>Introduction One and a half years ago I switched to the Sublime editor as my favourite code editor (or IDE). For Python I used to use mainly IntelliJ but always thought that it feels too sluggish, slow and consumes rather massive memory. Also, I don&amp;rsquo;t like its default key bindings (I know, everything can be set up here, too. But still&amp;hellip;)
Furthermore, as I am a heavy gretl user, I came across Sublime as it&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to write your own package for adding syntax support for a new language.</description>

      <title>Analyzing football data using gretl</title>

      <description>Introduction Recently I stumbled over Julius Krumbiegel&amp;rsquo;s nice little data analysis exercise entitled &amp;ldquo;Analyzing international football results with Julia&amp;rdquo;. As the title already says, he&amp;rsquo;s using Julia for this task.
The dataset used is cool, and I thought that this may be a nice little exercise to show how to replicate Julius&#39; results using my favourite data tool named gretl &amp;ndash; an open-source statistics and econometrics cross-platform software.
You can find my repository hosting the script, data and output of this exercise here.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m an economist currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at www.otto.de &amp;ndash; one of the Europe&amp;rsquo;s largest e-commerce shops. My main job is to develop forecasting models in the retail and logistics field, respectively.
I love the idea of open-source, and try to contribute to that idea. I have written or co-authored quite a number of packages for the open-source statistics and econometrics library named Gretl.
Here is an overview about my Gretl packages.</description>
