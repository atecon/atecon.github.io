      <description>Introduction Recently I stumbled over Julius Krumbiegel&amp;rsquo;s nice little data analysis exercise entitled &amp;ldquo;Analyzing international football results with Julia&amp;rdquo;. As the title already says, he&amp;rsquo;s using Julia for this task.
The dataset used is cool, and I thought that this may be a nice little exercise to show how to replicate Julius&#39; results using my favourite data tool named gretl &amp;ndash; an open-source statistics and econometrics cross-platform software.
You can find my repository hosting the script, data and output of this exercise here.</description>

      <description>Iâ€™m an economist currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at www.otto.de &amp;ndash; one of the Europe&amp;rsquo;s largest e-commerce shops. My main job is to develop forecasting models in the retail and logistics field, respectively.
I love the idea of open-source, and try to contribute to that idea. I have written or co-authored quite a number of packages for the open-source statistics and econometrics library named Gretl.
Here is an overview about my Gretl packages.</description>
